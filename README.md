Mood Detection And Recommendation System
[Look for The PDF containing SRS document in the repo]
- The software would take login information from the user
-  We would store the login information in a database
- We’ll request access to the user's webcam and upon getting access get the camera feed in the form of images or videos.
- We’ll use our CNN/OpenCV to process the images and detect the mood of the user. We’ll store this information in our database to further improve model
- We’ll present the user with the mood that we detected and ask the user if we should recommend curated content to alleviate their mood.
- If the user agrees then our recommender system which uses RNN/BERT to perform correlation analysis and present the user with recommended content from its database in the form of memes, videos, and music to help the user better regulate their mood.
